# EGroupware development- and translation-tools

DevelopmentTools currently consist of two distinct parts/tools:

### TranslationTools
Allow to translate EGroupware for all supported languages or add new languages. Translators can use our hosted version at https://translation.egroupware.org/, while EGroupware developers usually have the app installed on their development system to add new english phrases for the translators.

> This is currently still work-in-progress aiming to replace our old/ancient eTemplate application ...

### DB-Tools
Used to create and update the neccessary files under `$app/setup/`, which EGroupware needs to create new DB schema and update existing ones.
